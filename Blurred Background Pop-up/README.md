<!-- Blurred Background Pop-up -->

# Blurred Background Pop-up
This project is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application that displays a blurred background pop-up with a 20% OFF offer. It features a background image, a title, a button to join, and an email input field within the pop-up container. The pop-up appears when the "Click to join" button is clicked and can be closed by clicking the close icon.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the project's structure and elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the project.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the pop-up functionality.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code selects the necessary elements from the HTML document and adds event listeners to the button and close icon. When the "Click to join" button is clicked, the pop-up container is displayed by adding the "active" class to it and the container. When the close icon is clicked, the "active" class is removed, hiding the pop-up.
