# ImageHunt  App
This project is an ImageHunt App that allows users to search for images using keywords.
It utilizes the Unsplash API to fetch and display the search results.
The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can enter their search query and view the corresponding images.

## Features
1. Background Image: The app initially displays a background image, creating an appealing visual experience for the users.
2. Search Input: Users can enter their search query in the input field provided.
3. Search Button: By clicking the search button, the app triggers the searchImages() function to fetch and display the search results.

5. Show More Button: If there are multiple pages of search results, the app shows a "Show More" button. Clicking on this button fetches and appends the next page of search results.
